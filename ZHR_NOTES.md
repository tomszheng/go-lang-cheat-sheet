```go
// Closures
func outer() (func() int, int) {
    outer_var := 2
    inner := func() int {
        outer_var += 99 // outer_var from outer scope is mutated.
        return outer_var
    }
    inner()
    return inner, outer_var // return inner func and mutated outer_var 101
}
```

- There are 2 things to return in this function, one is `func() int` and another is `int`.
